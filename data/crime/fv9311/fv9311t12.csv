"Note: Includes only inmates with a current conviction. Estimates may differ from previously published BJS reports. To account for differences in the 1997 and 2004 inmate survey questionnaires, the analytical methodology used in 1997 was revised to ensure comparability with the 2004 survey. Detail may not sum to total as inmates may have had possessed more than one firearm.",,,,,,,,,,
